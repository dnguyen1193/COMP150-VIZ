Fall 2015
Assignment 3: Force-Directed Node-Link Diagram
Due: Monday, October 26th

Team Members:
    - Filipe Barroso
    - Duyen Nguyen

We both worked on parsing the data, storing it into data structures, and
figuring out the basic implementation of the algorithm together.
Filipe worked on implementing everything as PVectors instead of separate
X and Y floats, as well as creating the control panel for the user interface.
Duyen worked on debugging the node dragging and highlighting and Coulomb's law
implementation.
