Extra Credit
    We created a Control Panel that allows the user to dynamically change the
	system values.  The end use has the following options in the control panel:
		- Update K1 constant
			Value used in Hooke's law
		- Update K2 constant
			Value used in Coulomb's Law
		- Energy Threshold
			This represents the energy cutoff threshold for the system.  If the
			overall total energy falls below this value the system will stop 
			updating itself.
		- Damping
			Value that is multiplied by the velocity on every iteration.  The
			value should be between 0 - 1.  Where .8 represents 80% of the 
			previous value.  .2 represents 20% of the previous value etc.
		- Space Mode
			This is a fun mode that will change the background of the dialog
			as well as the fonts & colors used in the graph.  When the hover
			text is over the black space the text will appear orange.  On the
			other hand, when the edge hover text is over planet earth it will
			appear black.  The edge colors are red etc.
		- Edge Data
			This flag determines whether the edge info is displayed.  Edge data
			consists of the start node, end node, resting length as well as 
			current length (e.g. edge<1,17> (100, 150).  This indicates the 
			starting node id is 1, end Node 17, resting length 100 & current
			length is 150.
		- Reset Button
			This button will dynamically generate new x & y locations for each 
			node.  This is extremely useful for resetting everything once the
			other K1, K2, & damping constants have been changed and the system
			is more or less at rest, allowing the user to quickly see how it 
			impacts a new set of nodes that are randomly generated.
