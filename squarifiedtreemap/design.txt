For this assignment, we decided to only implement the basic requirements for 
the assignment. Instead of focusing on implementing additional features, we 
worked with the basics and add subtle design features that would make our 
squarified treemap easier to use visually, making it easier for a user to
understand and interpret the data in the process. 

We noticed in our first version that it was sometimes difficult to click or
hover over the rectangle one wanted without accidentally clicking or hovering
over its parent or child. Because of this, in the second iteration, we made 
the padding of the rectangles bigger, to make it easier for someone to use 
the mouse to hover over a specific rectangle.  Additionally, we added tooltips:
when a rectangle is highlighted, a tooltip displaying its ID and value also
pops up, making the magnitude of the data accessible both visually as
rectangles and as text.

We also made the frame rate slightly higher to make the program
more responsive. 

In class, we discussed the benefits of certain visual attributes. Humans have 
evolved to be able to distinguish and differentiate colors. We made the color 
of the rectangle dependent on which level of the tree it belonged to, so that 
nodes of the same depth would be grouped visually. Because of the human eye's 
pattern recognition capabilities and color perception, viewers will be able 
to pick out which nodes are deeper relatively than others, without having 
to closely examine the visualization.
